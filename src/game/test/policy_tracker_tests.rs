//! Policy tracker tests for different player counts
//!
//! Tests based on the Secret Hitler XL rules for policy tracker configuration:
//! - Policy tracker setup for different player counts
//! - Power activation thresholds for different game sizes
//! - Policy placement tracking and validation
//! - Executive power triggering based on policy count
//! - Policy tracker state management
//!
//! AMBIGUITY NOTES:
//! - Policy tracker configuration: test.md doesn't specify exact tracker layouts for all player counts
//! - ASSUMPTION: Policy tracker follows standard Secret Hitler patterns scaled for XL
//! - Power activation timing: unclear if powers activate immediately or at end of turn
//! - ASSUMPTION: Powers activate immediately when threshold is reached

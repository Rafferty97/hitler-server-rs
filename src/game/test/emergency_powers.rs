//! Emergency power cards tests
//!
//! Tests based on the Secret Hitler XL rules for emergency power cards:
//! - Article 48 Powers (President): Propaganda, Policy Peek, Impeachment, Marked for Execution, Execution, Presidential Pardon
//! - Enabling Act Powers (Chancellor): Propaganda, Policy Peek, Impeachment, Marked for Execution, Execution, Vote of No Confidence
//! - 1 per player above 10, 2 per player above 13 if using Communists
//! - Maximum 6 emergency powers enforced (3 Article 48, 3 Enabling Act)
//!
//! AMBIGUITY NOTES:
//! - Emergency power distribution: rules.pdf states "1 per player above 10, 2 per player above 13
//!   if using Communists" but unclear if this is cumulative or replacement rule.
//! - ASSUMPTION: Using replacement rule (simpler interpretation)
//! - QUESTION: For 14 players with communists, is it 4 or 6 emergency powers?
//! - These tests expect emergency power variants in ExecutiveAction enum (currently missing)
